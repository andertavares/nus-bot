=A Starcraft: Broodwar Bot Using BWAPI=

==Project Description & Scope==

Upon current research frontier, to introduce novice AI technology and build/enhance an autonomous agent, in the form of computer program in *StarCraft* game platform, to solve some/all comprehensive problems.

ie: how to model expert knowledge, how to reason with imperfect information in a vast-state competitive environment, how to adapt and act in real time and how to evolve through machine learning.

Literature review is in progress, ie: https://code.google.com/p/bwapi/wiki/Academics


==Project Assumption & Resources==

  * Project team finalization and formation by *_24-August-2013_*
  * Appreciate ISS assigns a mentor for publishing a research paper and the overall project.
  * 60 mandays per resource per year (8 hours per week) is required from each ISS project team member.
  * Project deliverables for *2014 StarCraft AI competition*, AI robot program and research paper are to be ready by end of *_July-2014_* for submission.
  * To build our novice AI technologies and/or algorithms based on available open source AI architectures. The purpose is to minimize the code integration, and to concentrate on the novice research and evaluate the result/value to be produced.

==Recent Progress ==

  * AIIDE 2014 Starcraft AI competition - Registration on *_26-February-2014_*
  * Phase0 - Project proposal and plan submitted on *_26-February-2014_*
